## Dashboard Section
- I created this dashboard section using three core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
### üüß HTML(HyperText Markup Language)
- I used HTML to create the layout of the dashboard.
- It includes:
  - A welcome message for the user.
  - Four boxes to show information like streak, coins, achievements, and learning hours.
  - Five buttons to switch between sections (like Overview, My Courses, Tasks, etc.).
  - Different content sections for each tab.
  
### üé® CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
- I used CSS to style and decorate the webpage.
- I used it to:
  - Added colors, gradients, and background designs.
  - Styled the buttons with hover effects and make them colorful.
  - Created a responsive layout so it works on mobile screens too.
  - Added animations to make the content appear smoothly.
  
### ‚öôÔ∏è JavaScript (JS)
- I used JavaScript to make the page interactive.
- I used it to:
  - Switch between different sections (tabs) when a button is clicked.
  - Only show the selected content and hide the rest.
  - Add or remove special active styles to buttons when clicked.
